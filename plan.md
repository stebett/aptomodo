# Devlog
## Day 1
- Brainstorming

## Day 2
- Basic code for 2D world
- Look at the commits

# TODO
- fix player position, centering it
- add animation for attack
- construct level 1
- Write dialogs
# Plan
1. Write the code for fighting and moving and evoking
2. Code the 5 levels without any texture and minimal dialog
3. Draw the levels
4. Get the assets
5. Code the time reversal (set a maximum time)
6. Finish up the dialogs
7. Sound system
8. Visual touch ups
9. Balance fix with extensive play tests
10.make a titlescreen with a moving image of an eye in the background and a press any butto =n to sra==tartZZ

# Plan
## 1. Write the code for fighting and moving and evoking
- Real time fighting
- You make swings which are arc circles, deal damage and push back based on sword
- Secondary attack is a bit more charged but is 360 degrees
- You can evoke fire and wind, spraying wind on fire makes it expand
- Enemy ai is very simple, comes towards you avoiding tiles on fire and obstacles
## 2. Code the 5 levels without any texture and minimal dialog
- Put already some obstacles, so that running and hiding is a viable strategy
## 3. Draw the levels
- Ldtk, make the colors go from fire to winter (red to blue, not green! we don't want hope, just melanchony)
## 4. Get the assets
- Remember to cite
- Change them a bit, maybe there can be some way to map the colors
## 5. Code the time reversal (set a maximum time)
- Try to do the complex thing, but if it doens't work, make it simple and see if you have time in the end
## 6. Finish up the dialogs
- Font and everything as well
## 7. Sound system
- Freesound.org
- Simple music, going more harh and strident with high pain
- Or maybe the music is high ( classical, violin) on high levels and low (very low frequency bass) on low levels
## 8. Visual touch ups
- Maybe a shader for the high pain
## 9. Balance fix with extensive play tests
- Maybe add different types of ai behaviors and enemy attacks if you have time


# Plot

Start from the end, you fight like a demon and he beats you, but instead of killing you he forces you to sit and contemplate your mistakes. The immense pain caused by this opens a time warp
The objective of the game is to go back in time and fix your mistakes 
Every mistake creates a knot in spacetime (is that the actual aberration?)
Going back in time adds a 3d dimension to the 2d game
How to visualize?
    Camera moves from top to front, and you see the flat frame with below other flat frames
    your character is a point that has a trajectory that comes from down (before in time) to up (up to the present)
    
The mistakes that you made are choices to gain powers sacrificing something, so the more you go back in time, the less powers you will have (so the game will be harder)

How to create time warps?
    You sit and contemplate your pain (you need to have killed all enemies)
    Or you have your pain level rise with both wounds and contemplation between enemies waves, which could be infinite


4 levels

# level 4 - start
You fight a demon for his helmet and lose, going back to level 3
- Equip
    - damned elf sword
    - orcs magic boots
    - demonic chestpiece
- Skills
    - Evoke fire and wind
Dialog on the meaning of logos

# level 3 - battle against demons
You fight for the chestpiece
- Equip
    - damned elf sword
    - orcs magic boots
- Skills
    - Evoke wind
Dialog on the meaning of affections

# level 2- battle against orcs
You fight for the magic boots
- Equip
    - damned elf sword
Dialog on the meaning of pleasure

# level 1 - battle against elfs
- Equip
    - Behelit
- Skill
    - Sacrifice

There is no actual battle, elfs are your friends, you are dying and you have a conversation with the queen on your deathbed. You are desparate because your life didn't mean anything, she conforts you but your desperation is so deep it opens a time warp, so big that everybody is taken inside.
You are then asked if you want to sacrifice everyone again to save yourself and become even more powerful then the first time, if you do the game goes on in order but it's harder (you are more cursed for taking twice the same choice)
If you don't the game ends and you win (? you still die).

# level 4 again
You can beat the level 4 demon getting one more power (go berserker?), and if you do level 5 is just stronger and stronger demons spawning, but you can't feel anymore pain

# level 5
Stronger and stronger demons
- Equip
    - berserker armor and helmet
    - double damned elf sword
- Skill
    stop time?
Dialog are random zen-christian sentences demonized like 
    What is the sound of the clap of one 
    Who is the you who asks who is the you who asks...
    Your dog is not human, is your human human?
    Inflict the pain you want to receive

# Gameplay
From above, you evoke fire/ice on click with mana constraint, you have a primary and secondary attacks and maybe amulets

During fights there will dialog, which can trigger pain as a result

When going back in time, maybe there is a mini-game that you have to keep playing until you get to the node, otherwise you start back where you were

Fights are shorter when you go back in time

How to create time warps?
    You have your pain level rise with both wounds and contemplation between enemies waves, which could be infinite

# Rithm
High pace battle, slower time reversal and calm but intense dialog, then repeat with variations
